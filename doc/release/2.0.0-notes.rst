NumPy 2.0.0 Release Notes

Highlights
==========


New features
============

Custom formatter for printing arrays
------------------------------------



Changes
=======

The <ufunc>.reduce functions evaluates some reductions in a different
order than in previous versions of NumPy, generally providing higher
performance. Because of the nature of floating-point arithmetic, this
may subtly change some results, just as linking NumPy to a different
BLAS implementations such as MKL can. [FIXME: confirm that this is
still true after the NA handling reversion.]

Deprecations
============

Specifying a custom string formatter with a `_format` array attribute is
deprecated. The new `formatter` keyword in ``numpy.set_printoptions`` or
``numpy.array2string`` can be used instead.
